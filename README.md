# BigQuery Query Projects

This repository contains SQL files with BigQuery queries for various projects related to work tasks.

## Description
The SQL files in this repository contain queries written for different projects, including:
- Commission Not Given (`commission_not_given.sql`)
- Pivot Transaction Summary (`pivot_trans_summary.sql`)
- Agent Submissions (`agent_submissions.sql`)
- Funding Unaffected (`funding_unaffected.sql`)

Each SQL file represents a separate project or task and contains the corresponding BigQuery queries.

## Files
- `commission_not_given.sql`: Contains queries related to identifying cases where commission was not given.
- `pivot_trans_summary.sql`: Contains queries for generating a pivot transaction summary report for a given period.
- `agent_submissions.sql`: Contains queries related to picking and correctly formatting agent submissions.
- `funding_unaffected.sql`: Contains queries for analyzing cases where transactions didn't affect the users wallet.

## Usage
To use the queries:
1. Ensure you have access to Google BigQuery.
2. Open the SQL file corresponding to the project you are interested in.
3. Copy the queries from the file and execute them in the BigQuery console or any other SQL client.
